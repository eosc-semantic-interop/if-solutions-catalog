# Open Conformance Declaration

|Type|Status|

Problem ID(s) this solutions adresses:
- T2

## Description
Mechanism to clearly describe conformance to standards, and have web services and resources disclose such through available open information retrieval.

## Problems that CAN be solved with this IF solution
- Detect cases of non-interoperability
- Document and count costs associated to those cases
- Describe fixes and pathways for resolution that worked
- Be a practical way to calculate KPI on "stadarddisation usage and adoption" (from the EOSC-Federation-Handbook)

## Limitations of this IF solution
needs implementations in actual code / tools

## Description of use case/scenario/case of study for this IF solution
- I want to measure and monitor the size and shape of the EOSC (non-)interoperability problem. Which standards  (for both services as well as data formats) are used across the board, to what level are they used, who does not even declare that, between which domains exists oportunistic overlap, or dire missing compatibility
