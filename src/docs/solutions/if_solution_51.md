Problem ID(s) this solutions adresses:
- T2

## Description
A server/client solution which provides access to data in a user format (specified in query) 

## Problems that CAN be solved with this IF solution
Access content, not files, using an API on datasets

## Limitations of this IF solution
needs internet and client interface

## Description of use case/scenario/case of study for this IF solution
Distribute data without accessing files: can be any format in server side. Client asks for specific format (e.g., CSV). Can also add processing on the fly (very useful for huge data files, for browsing ressources before accessing highest resolution)
