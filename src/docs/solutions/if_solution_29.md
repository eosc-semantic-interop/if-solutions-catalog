Problem ID(s) this solutions adresses:
- S1

## Description
Scan metadata records and datasets to identify which semantic artefacts could be used if only text is provided. Can be used for instruments platfomrs, keywords and observable properties in the environmental domain

## Problems that CAN be solved with this IF solution
Semantic annotation of datasets that lack semantics
Suggestions for annotations of not appropriately annotated datasets

## Limitations of this IF solution
environmental domain

## Description of use case/scenario/case of study for this IF solution
We needed to semantically harmonise datasets from different env domains. We used geoDAB broker for syntactic interoperability and the semantic analyser to semantically enhance the non annotated (or wrongly annotated) datasets
