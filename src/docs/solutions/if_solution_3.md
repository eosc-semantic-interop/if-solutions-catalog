Problem ID(s) this solutions adresses:
- S2

## Description
Decribed algorithm based on current best practices from ODIS, CDIF, sitemap protocol, FairSignposting, ... a.o in common web practice to publish 

with the aim to find and harvest available semantic descritions of digital resources (FDOs)

## Problems that CAN be solved with this IF solution
Always and predictably find information on all available digital resources with the lowest possible steps involved on both publication and retrieval without inventing anything new, just using what is out there already.

## Limitations of this IF solution
needs implementations in actual code / tools

## Description of use case/scenario/case of study for this IF solution
- I have the URL to a diigital object, I want to be able to automatically find all that is automatically findable about this.

## Link to documentation (URL)
[(draft) IF guide on "open information retrieval"]((draft) IF guide on "open information retrieval")

## EOSC project/initiative, that is working on the solution
EOSC-A IF TaskForce
