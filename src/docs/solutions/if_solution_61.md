## Description
MOD (Metadata for Ontology Description and Publication Ontology) is about building an OWL vocabulary (based on DCAT) to capture metadata information for ontologies, vocabularies or semantic resources/artefacts in general. MOD-API is a specification for a standard semantic artefacts catalogue API based on MOD.


## Problems that CAN be solved with this IF solution
Semantic description of semantic artefacts with a standard semantic web vocabulary (MOD) and interoperability of semantic artefact catalogues with a specification of a shared standard API to implement. 

## Limitations of this IF solution
It was developed before the EOSC Nodes concept. Although the Node terminology is not used, the guidelines are still applicable.

It is currently being extended as part of the work of the EOSC AAI WG and a new version is expected by the ended of th year.

## Description of use case/scenario/case of study for this IF solution
Being adopted by many devlopers of semantic artefact catalogues in the context of FAIR-IMPACT's open call. For instances: OLS, OntoPortal and SKOSMOS, ShoxVoc, etc.

## EOSC project/initiative, that is working on the solution
FAIR-IMPACT

## Any other comment
FAIR-IMPACT does not develop semantic artefacts, but address their FAIR design and lifecycle. Strong contribution of the documentation of semantic artefact especially within AgroPortal and EcoPortal.
