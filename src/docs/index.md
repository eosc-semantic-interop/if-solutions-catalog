# Interoperability Framework solutions

The EOSC Interoperability Framework (v1.0) outlined a set of challenges and needs faced by the user communities targeted by EOSC, as well as by those aiming to provide services within EOSC. During the EOSC Winter School 2025, participants were invited to identify solutions—either currently available or under development—that could help realise the EOSC Interoperability Framework. These solutions are presented here as submitted by the Winter School participants.
