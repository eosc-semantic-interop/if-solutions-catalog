## **Semantic Layer**

| **ID** | **Problem** | **Needs** | **Recommendations** |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **S1** | Lack of common explicit definitions for terms used by user communities. | Harmonisation across disciplines. | Communities should generate clear, precise definitions for concepts, metadata, and data schemas. Definitions must be public, PID‑referenced, and shared in EOSC. |
| **S2** | Lack of common semantic artefacts across communities (ontologies, schemas). | Principled approaches and tools for ontology/schema creation, maintenance, governance, and use. | Semantic artefacts should be openly licensed and accessible. |
| **S3** | Lack of common reference repositories or registries of semantic artefacts. | Harmonisation of data of the same type. | All semantic artefacts in EOSC must include sufficient documentation, examples, and conceptual diagrams. |
| **S4** | Poorly documented data collections; no common metadata schema across communities. | EOSC support for semantic artefact repositories and governance frameworks. | Propose a minimum metadata model (DCAT‑AP, DDI 4 Core, DataCite, OpenAIRE). Extend recommendations to software, workflows, protocols, hardware. Provide federation/harvesting building blocks. |
| **S5** | Lack of semantic expertise and skills in some communities. | Capacity building and training. | Develop training, guidance, and community support structures to improve semantic literacy. |

## **Technical Layer**

| **ID** | **Problem** | **Needs** | **Recommendations** |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **T1** | Authentication and authorisation must often be repeated for each community/service. | Seamless authentication and rights acquisition for EOSC services. | Use open specifications to ensure technical interoperability when establishing EOSC services. |
| **T2** | Research data exists in many heterogeneous formats (CSV, JSON, XML, NetCDF, FITS, etc.). | A trusted, sustainable cross‑community framework; a minimum metadata application profile for EOSC. | Define a common security and privacy framework and establish trustworthy data‑exchange processes. |
| **T3** | Difficulty finding coarse‑ or fine‑grained data from unfamiliar communities. | Discovery mechanisms supporting multiple levels of granularity. | Provide clear, understandable SLAs for all EOSC resource providers. |
| **T4** | Multiple PID providers with different policies; some PIDs not resolvable; duplicates exist. | A common, well‑understood PID policy across communities. | EOSC must enable easy access to heterogeneous data formats and provide tools to overcome differences. Provide coarse‑ and fine‑grained search tools. Establish a clear E
