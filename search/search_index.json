DCAT-FE can be applied independently of whether data is published via traditional catalogues or through subsetting services. The DCAT-FE specification is openly available on the FE GitHub (https://github.com/fair-ease/asset-standards/tree/main/DCAT-AP) and will be actively maintained post-project via version-controlled updates to support the inclusion of emerging (meta)data fields. Through its adoption, DCAT-FE has the potential to evolve into a cross-disciplinary community standard for dataset description across the EOSC ecosystem. To showcase the added benefits of adopting DCAT-FE, in the context of FAIR-EASE, the Interdisciplinary Data Discovery and Access Service (IDDAS) was developed. The IDDAS contains a User Interface, DCAT-AP profile, SPARQL API and VRE widget that allows users to search for relevant data using a faceted search based on keywords connected to the metadata. By testing and setting up this type of searching and accessing of multi-disciplinary data in FAIR-EASE, the improvements over traditional access catalogues are identified. As such, not the IDDAS as an infrastructure will remain operational, but rather the developments that showed improvements in terms of multi-disciplinary data access will be brought forward, demonstrated and possibly exploited in light of the EOSC federation of nodes. This includes candidate nodes such as Blue-Cloud2026 and ENVRI RI\u2019s, (thematic) and French Data-Terra (national) that have direct relevance to these improvements like the RDF multi-disciplinary metadata description and semantic harmonization.
